<h1>Excel Data Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
- Analyzed multi-year state-level workplace inspection and injury data using Microsoft Excel to uncover patterns and regional trends in workplace safety.

- Cleaned and structured raw data sets to enable accurate comparisons of inspections per year, injury rates by state, and year-over-year changes.

- Created pivot tables, slicers, and interactive charts to drill down by state and year, providing stakeholders with a clear view of high-risk areas.

- Applied conditional formatting to highlight states with significantly high injury rates or low inspection coverage.
